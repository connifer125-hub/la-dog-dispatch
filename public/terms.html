    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using LA Dog Dispatch ("the Platform," "we," "us," or "our") at ladogdispatch.com, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Platform.</p>

    <h2>2. About LA Dog Dispatch</h2>
    <p>LA Dog Dispatch is a coordination platform powered by <a href="https://hotgirlscare.com" target="_blank">Hot Girls Care</a>, a Los Angeles-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. LA Dog Dispatch aggregates publicly available information about dogs on euthanasia lists at Los Angeles County animal shelters, connecting donors, fosters, rescue organizations, and volunteers to help urgent dogs find safety before their deadlines.</p>
    <p>Hot Girls Care is the legal nonprofit entity responsible for donation management, fund oversight, and organizational compliance. LA Dog Dispatch is the operational coordination platform through which that mission is executed.</p>
    <p>We are not a rescue organization, animal shelter, or veterinary service. We do not take physical custody of animals.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of the Platform</h2>
    <p>You may use the Platform for lawful purposes only. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the Platform to harass, threaten, or harm any person or animal</li>
        <li>Submit false or misleading information through any form on the Platform</li>
        <li>Attempt to disrupt or interfere with the Platform's operation</li>
        <li>Scrape or reproduce Platform data for commercial purposes without permission</li>
        <li>Impersonate a rescue organization, shelter, or LA Dog Dispatch staff</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Donations</h2>
    <p>Donations made through the Platform are processed by GiveButter, a third-party payment processor. LA Dog Dispatch does not directly handle payment card information. All donations are subject to GiveButter's terms of service.</p>
    <p>There are three ways to donate through LA Dog Dispatch:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Donate to a specific dog's fund</strong> — When you donate to a specific dog, we actively work to share and reshare that dog to maximize their visibility and rescue chances. If a dog is successfully rescued, we will communicate that outcome to donors. If a dog cannot be rescued before their deadline despite our best efforts, the funds are redirected to the next urgent dog on the list. Our mission is to save dogs — every dollar stays in service of that goal.</li>
        <li><strong>Donate to the LA Dog Dispatch fund</strong> — A general fund (available as one-time or recurring) that supports rescue coordination, platform operations, and urgent dogs as needs arise. This fund is managed by Hot Girls Care, the nonprofit behind LA Dog Dispatch.</li>
        <li><strong>Donate to Hot Girls Care directly</strong> — Hot Girls Care is the nonprofit organization that powers LA Dog Dispatch and runs community events including fashion shows and advocacy programming for dogs. Donations to Hot Girls Care can be made at the Hot Girls Care website.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Refund policy:</strong> We do not offer refunds on donations. All funds go directly toward dog rescue and care. If you have a question about a specific donation, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@ladogdispatch.com">hello@ladogdispatch.com</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Donor communication:</strong> We are committed to keeping donors informed. When a dog you funded is rescued, we will make every effort to notify you. When funds are redirected due to a dog not being rescued in time, we will communicate that as well.</p>

    <h2>5. Volunteer & Foster Applications</h2>
    <p>Submitting a foster, transport, or volunteer application does not guarantee placement or participation. Applications are reviewed and matched based on availability, location, and dog needs. We reserve the right to decline any application at our discretion.</p>
    <p>Foster and transport volunteers assume responsibility for their own safety and the wellbeing of animals in their temporary care. LA Dog Dispatch is not liable for any injury, damage, or loss arising from volunteer activities.</p>

    <h2>6. Rescue Organization Access</h2>
    <p>Rescue organizations granted dashboard access agree to use the Platform in good faith to facilitate animal rescue. Misuse of rescue-level access, including misrepresentation of organizational status, may result in immediate termination of access.</p>

    <h2>7. Animal Information Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Dog profiles on the Platform are generated from publicly available data scraped from Los Angeles County shelter systems (PetHarbor). We make reasonable efforts to keep information current, but we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any animal's listing, deadline, or status. Always verify directly with the relevant shelter before taking action.</p>

    <h2>8. SMS Alerts</h2>
    <p>By providing your phone number and opting in to SMS alerts, you consent to receive automated text messages from LA Dog Dispatch regarding urgent dogs and platform updates. Message and data rates may apply. You may opt out at any time by replying STOP to any message.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The LA Dog Dispatch name, logo, and Platform design are the property of LA Dog Dispatch. Dog photos sourced from LA County shelter systems remain the property of their respective owners. You may share Platform content for non-commercial rescue and advocacy purposes with attribution.</p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Platform is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. LA Dog Dispatch is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Platform, including but not limited to outcomes related to animal rescue, donation disputes, or volunteer activities.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the Platform after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. We will post the date of the most recent update at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about these terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@ladogdispatch.com">hello@ladogdispatch.com</a>.</p>
