How LA Dog Dispatch Changes the Timeline
Today, many urgent dogs receive visibility only after:
		A volunteer films them
		A post circulates
		Algorithms surface it
		Pledges appear in comments
By then, days may have passed.
LA Dog Dispatch starts visibility immediately.
The moment a dog appears on the euth list:
		A funding page is created
		The dog is shared across the network
		Donors can act right away
		Rescues can see confirmed support
Every dog gets a chance. Not just the ones who happen to be filmed.
Your Impact
When you fund a specific dog:
		Your per-dog donation is distributed directly to the rescue that commits to pull.
		You receive confirmation when the dog is safe.
		You know exactly who you helped.
Monthly membership donations support operational costs that keep the platform running — including hosting, automation, and coordination tools.
Per-dog donations go to rescues. Membership sustains the system.
This breakthrough coordination platform is powered by the nonprofit Hot Girls Care, which supports multiple community initiatives beyond LA Dog Dispatch.
Sustain the System
Monthly members ensure urgent dogs are visible and funded earlier by supporting the technology and coordination infrastructure behind LA Dog Dispatch.

Dogs don't run out of time because people don't care.
They run out of time because visibility starts too late.
We start it earlier.
